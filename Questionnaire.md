## Security

Degree to which a product or system defends against attack patterns by malicious actos and protects information and data so that persons or other products or systems have the degree of data access appropriate to their types and levels of authorization. This characteristic is composed of the following sub-characteristics:

- **Confidentiality -** Degree to which a product or system ensures that data are accessible only to those authorized to have access.
- **Integrity -** Degree to which a system, product or component ensures that the state of its system and data are protected from unauthorized modification or deletion either by malicious action or computer error.
- **Non-repudiation -** Degree to which actions or events can be proven to have taken place so that the events or actions cannot be repudiated later.
- **Accountability -** Degree to which the actions of an entity can be traced uniquely to the entity.
- **Authenticity -** Degree to which the identity of a subject or resource can be proved to be the one claimed.
- **Resistance -** Degree to which the product or system sustains operations while under attack from a malicious actor.

## Maintainability

This characteristic represents the degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be modified to improve it, correct it or adapt it to changes in environment, and in requirements. This characteristic is composed of the following sub-characteristics:

- **Modularity -** Degree to which a system or computer program is composed of discrete components such that a change to one component has minimal impact on other components.
- **Reusability -** Degree to which a product can be used as an asset in more than one system, or in building other assets.
- **Analysability -** Degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which it is possible to assess the impact on a product or system of an intended change to one or more of its parts, to diagnose a product for deficiencies or causes of failures, or to identify parts to be modified.
- **Modifiability -** Degree to which a product or system can be effectively and efficiently modified without introducing defects or degrading existing product quality.
- **Testability -** Degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which test criteria can be established for a system, product or component and tests can be performed to determine whether those criteria have been met.

## Flexibility

**Please answer the following questions as far as possible from the point of view of hazards to the above quality (sub)characteristics.**

### **4. If you encourage RPC-like behavior of the service by creating CRUD-type operations, expose the CRUD operations directly in the interface URL. What problems do you think this will cause?**



### 5. If a service is primarily composed of accessor methods (such as getters/setters), with high data cohesion and methods that mainly handle small and basic type parameters. What problems do you think this will cause?



### 6. If a service has a large number of private or protected methods that mainly focus on utility functionalities (such as logging) rather than the primary operational objectives. What problems do you think this will cause?



### 7. If a microservices system contains a group of services that perform similar or the same functionalities (semantic duplication). What problems do you think this will cause?



### 8. Weak source code and knowledge management for different services can lead to what problems in your opinion?



### 9. What problems do you think would arise if microservices systems are divided into teams based on technical layers rather than business functions?



### 10. What problems do you think would arise if documentation is disregarded or neglected during microservices development, including a lack of documentation detailing API descriptions?



### 11. What problems do you think would arise if each microservice's generated logs are stored locally without a unified distributed logging mechanism to aggregate all logs?



### 12. What problems do you think would arise if service configurations are entirely done manually by developers?



### 13. What problems do you think would arise if the service response time is too long or if the service is unavailable?



### 14. What problems do you think would arise if each microservice uses a unified DevOps toolchain?



### 15. What problems do you think would arise if there are unused services in a microservices system?



### 16. What problems do you think would arise if multiple services are called consecutively to fulfill a single request and achieve the ultimate business goal?



### 17. What problems do you think would arise if messages sent or received during communication between microservices contain no actual useful data?



### 18. What problems do you think would arise if there is a focus on using the latest technologies during development?



### 19. What problems do you think would arise if multiple instances of microservices are deployed on a single node or container, with these instances sharing the resources of that single node or container?



### 20. What problems do you think would arise if manual intervention is required to address and redirect to available service instances when the target service is unavailable?
